📍 Find nearby stores: Our app uses maps to show you all the stores in your area that carry the products you're looking for.

💜 Keep track of your favorites: Create a list of your favorite products to easily check their availability when you need to buy them.

🤝 Help fellow shoppers: Scan a product and share if it's in or out of stock to help other users know before they go.
