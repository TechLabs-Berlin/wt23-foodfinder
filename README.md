## Summary

FoodFinder is designed to help you find products at your neighborhood stores. The app helps you to avoid traveling far to find what you need and support local businesses in your community.
Benefits:
- Find nearby stores: The app uses maps to show you all the stores near you that carry the products you need.
- Keep track of your favorites: Create a list of your favorites to easily check their availability when you need to buy them.
- Help fellow shoppers: Search for a product and share if it’s available or not to help other users know before they go.

We believe that building a strong sense of community starts with making everyday tasks like grocery shopping easier and more convenient. Share in the joy of a more connected neighborhood!
