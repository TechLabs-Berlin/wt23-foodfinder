## About

Our app is designed to help people in the neighborhood find the products they need at nearby stores. By using our app, you can avoid traveling long distances to find what you need and support local businesses in your community.

Here's what our app can do for you:

- Find nearby stores: Our app uses maps to show you all the stores in your area that carry the products you're looking for.

- Keep track of your favorites: Create a list of your favorite products to easily check their availability when you need to buy them.

- Help fellow shoppers: Scan a product and share if it's in or out of stock to help other users know before they go.

We believe that building a strong sense of community starts with making everyday tasks like grocery shopping easier and more convenient. So join us today and start experiencing the benefits of a more connected neighborhood!
