**Introducing the FoodFinder APP: A Quick and Accurate Way to Find Suitable Products in Your Neighborhood**

Are you tired of spending hours searching for suitable products that meet your dietary restrictions? The FoodFinder APP is here to help! Designed to save you time and effort, the FoodFinder Mobile APP is a straightforward way to find products suitable for your needs as close to you as possible.

Food is an essential aspect of our lives that provides us with the necessary nutrients and energy to function. However, for many individuals with dietary restrictions, finding suitable food options can be a significant challenge. At FoodFinder, we understand this struggle and aim to provide a solution for people with special dietary needs, whether transitioning to veganism or cutting out specific foods from their diets.

Our app lets you search for specific products and displays nearby stores that stock those products, ranked by proximity to your location.

Furthermore, FoodFinder is continually being updated with new products and stores, so you can rest assured that you'll never run out of options. We understand the importance of having access to a wide range of food choices that align with your dietary restrictions, and that's precisely what FoodFinder aims to provide.

**Background**
The FoodFinder APP was developed to address the problem faced by grocery shoppers with dietary restrictions who need a quick and accurate way to find suitable products in their neighborhood. To create the app, we used a tech stack that includes Python, Postgres, SQL, Flask, Heroku, Figma, Miro, Canva, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React JS, Ionic, and backend Supabase. We also used FoodFinder API and Open Food Facts API to ensure that the app provides up-to-date product information.
Features and Benefits
The FoodFinder APP is designed to make your life easier. Here are some of its key features:
Customizable preferences: Users can customize their dietary preferences, such as vegan, gluten-free, or low-carb, to find products that meet their needs.
Real-time store locations: The app provides real-time locations of stores near you, so you can easily find what you need.
Up-to-date product information: The app uses FoodFinder API and Open Food Facts API to ensure that product information is accurate and up-to-date.
Time-saving: The app saves you time and effort by providing a quick and accurate way to find suitable products in your neighborhood.

**UX:**

FoodFinder began as an app to aid those with gluten intolerance and celiac disease. However, we soon realized the necessity to accommodate other dietary restrictions and expanded the app's scope. Further research was conducted on lactose intolerance, allergies, and other dietary needs to add relevant features.

Based on this two user personas were created—people who shop for themselves and people who buy it for others, for example, their children. A user journey to map out their pain points and emotions was also developed. Our team worked together on Miro to collaborate and share ideas and we worked on Figma for the wireframes and the prototype of the app which was shared with users for testing. We agreed on creating a simple interface, a happy chosen path that would allow users to fulfill the task of 'find a product near me'. This would help avoid clutter and highlight our two main features the product search and location map. 

Users were then asked to test out a flow like—doing a product search, getting a list of products, choosing one, going to the map, selecting a store, and providing feedback on availability. Users recorded themselves and shared problem areas like transitions, interactions, ability to complete tasks, etc. The feedback helped our team to make it flow even more smoothly. As the only UX person, it was challenging for me to know for sure whether I was headed in the right direction. But thanks to my team, track lead, and study buddies the project was successfully completed.
